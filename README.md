This is an unfinished project where I learnt to use supabase backend to create a restraunt booking system with an admin page to track bookings.

When a user creates a booking it is saved to the database and they are redirected to a uniue dynamic page with their booking id, the url can be saved and shared with others as it is persistent. The owner of the restaurant can then look on their admin page to see what upcoming bookings they have.

This was a fun project and the precursor to many more interesting projects to come and tools to use, most notibly my shift to direct postrgres db usage through drizzle orm instead of a middle man like supabase.
